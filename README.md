# atom-table-editor package

Inspired by great [Sublime Table Editor Package](https://github.com/vkocubinsky/SublimeTableEditor) from
[Valery Kocubinsky](https://github.com/vkocubinsky), I have started this project.

## Features

- within a table press <tab> to step to next cell (table will be reformatted with adjusted bars)

| foo  | bar |
|------|-----|
| hell | fh  |
